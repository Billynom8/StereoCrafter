# Merging GUI User Guide

The Merging GUI is a tool designed to take the outputs from the inpainting process and blend them into a final, high-quality stereoscopic video. It combines the original left-eye view with a newly created right-eye view, using a mask to seamlessly blend the inpainted areas.

## Main Interface

The interface is divided into several key sections:

### 1. Folders

This is where you specify the locations of your source and output files.

-   **Inpainted Video Folder:** The folder containing your right-eye videos generated by the Inpainting GUI (e.g., `*_inpainted_right_eye.mp4` or `*_inpainted_sbs.mp4`).
-   **Original Video Folder:** The folder with the original 2D source videos. This is required to provide the left-eye view for the final stereo video.
-   **Mask Folder:** The folder containing the high-resolution splatted files (e.g., `*_splatted4.mp4`). These files contain the mask that defines the blend area.
-   **Output Folder:** The destination where your final merged videos will be saved.

### 2. Live Preview

This section allows you to see a real-time preview of your blending settings on a single frame before starting a batch process.

-   **Preview Window:** Displays the output image. It's scrollable if the preview size is larger than the window.
-   **Frame Scrubber:** A slider to select which frame of the video you want to preview.
-   **Preview Source:** A dropdown menu to view different layers of the composition for diagnostics (e.g., just the mask, the original left eye, or the final blended image).
-   **Load/Refresh List:** Scans the `Inpainted Video Folder` and loads the first video for preview.
-   **Prev / Next / Jump to:** Buttons to navigate between the videos found in your inpainted folder.

### 3. Mask Processing Parameters

These sliders give you fine-grained control over how the mask is processed before it's used for blending. Changes are reflected instantly in the Live Preview.

-   **Binarize Thresh:** Converts the grayscale mask into pure black and white. Set to a negative value to disable.
-   **Dilate Kernel:** Expands the mask to cover up thin black lines at the edges of the inpainted area.
-   **Blur Kernel:** Softens the edges of the mask for a more gradual, feathered blend.
-   **Shadow Parameters:** A set of sliders (`Shift`, `Gamma`, `Opacity`) that create a subtle, soft shadow effect on the mask to improve depth perception.

### 4. Options

-   **Use GPU for Mask Processing:** Uses the GPU for faster mask processing. Uncheck to use the CPU, which is slower but uses almost no VRAM.
-   **Output Format:** A dropdown menu to select the final 3D video format. Options include standard Full Side-by-Side (SBS), Half-SBS for compatibility, Over/Under (Half SBS X2 Height), Cross-eye viewing, and Anaglyph for red/cyan glasses.
-   **Enable Color Transfer:** Corrects color shifts that may have been introduced by the inpainting model by matching the right eye's color palette to the original left eye.
-   **Preview Size:** Sets the maximum display size of the preview image. Larger values may impact UI performance.
-   **Batch Chunk Size:** The number of frames to process in memory at once. Lower this value if you run out of RAM on very long or high-resolution videos.

### 5. Progress and Controls

-   **Progress Bar:** Shows the progress of the overall batch operation.
-   **Status Label:** Displays the current status, such as which video is being processed or if an error has occurred.
-   **Start Blending:** Begins the batch processing for all found videos.
-   **Stop:** Halts the batch processing after the current video chunk is finished.

## Basic Workflow

1.  **Set Folders:** Fill in the paths for the `Inpainted`, `Original`, `Mask`, and `Output` folders.
2.  **Load Preview:** Click **Load/Refresh List** to load the first video.
3.  **Adjust Settings:** Use the **Frame Scrubber** to find a representative frame. Adjust the **Mask Processing Parameters** sliders until the blend in the preview window looks seamless.
4.  **Set Options:** Configure your output options (e.g., ensure `Use GPU` is checked and select your desired `Output Format`).
5.  **Start Processing:** Click **Start Blending** to process all videos in the batch.

## Menu Bar

-   **File Menu:** Allows you to load, save, and reset settings. You can also restore processed files from the "finished" subfolders back to the input folders for re-processing.
-   **Help Menu:** Contains an "About" dialog and a checkbox to **Enable Debug Logging**, which prints much more detailed information to the console for troubleshooting.

> **Tip:** Hover your mouse over any control to see a detailed tooltip explaining its function.
