    "title": "GUI Overview",
    "text": "Welcome to the DepthCrafter GUI!\n\nThis interface allows you to process videos to generate depth maps using the DepthCrafter model. Here's a quick rundown:\n\n- Directories: Specify your input video folder and where the output depth maps should be saved.\n\n- Main Parameters: Control core model settings like guidance, steps, resolution, and seed. 'CPU Offload' helps manage VRAM. 'cuDNN Benchmark' can speed up processing on Nvidia GPUs (requires restart if changed during processing). 'Save Sidecar JSON' creates metadata files for your outputs.\n\n- Frame & Segment Control: Manage how videos are read and processed. 'Window Size' and 'Overlap' are crucial for how the model sees the video, especially in segment mode. 'Process as Segments' is vital for long videos or low VRAM, breaking the video into manageable chunks. 'Target FPS' and 'Max Frames' control the input video length and speed.\n\n- Merged Output Options: If 'Process as Segments' is active, these options control how individual processed segments are combined into a final depth map video/sequence. You can choose output format, normalization methods, dithering (for 8-bit video), and more. 'Keep intermediate NPZ' allows you to retain the raw segment data and their visual outputs.\n\n- Buttons:\n  - Start: Begins processing videos from the input folder.\n  - Cancel: Stops the current processing batch after the current file/segment.\n  - Re-Merge Segments: Allows you to re-combine previously processed segments using different merge settings without re-processing the depth estimation.\n  - Generate Seg Visuals: Creates visual representations (MP4, PNGs, etc.) for already processed segment NPZ files, based on the 'Segment Visual Format' setting.\n  - Clear Log: Empties the log window.\n\n- Log: Displays progress, messages, and errors.\n\n- File Menu: Load/Save GUI settings, Reset to defaults, Exit.\n\nTooltips (‚ùì icons) provide specific help for many options when clicked!"

For example, if Window Size is 100 and Overlap is 20, segment 1 might be frames 0-99, segment 2 might be frames 80-179 internally for processing, leading to an output overlap for smoother merging.\n\nCommon values: 15-30 frames.

This helps ignore extreme dark outliers.\nTypical value: 0.1 to 1.0.\n\n'High' Specifies the upper percentile of depth values that will be mapped to white (or the maximum output value).\nFor example, a value of 99.9 means that the brightest 0.1% of pixels (above the 99.9th percentile) will be clipped or mapped to the maximum value.
