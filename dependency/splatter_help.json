    "input_source_clips_file": "Select a single video clip file to process.",
    "input_depth_maps": "Path to the folder containing your pre-rendered depth maps. Depth maps should be named 'videoname_depth.mp4' matching your input videos.",
    "input_depth_maps_folder": "Browse for a folder containing corresponding depth maps (e.g., video_name_depth.mp4/npz) for batch processing.",
    "input_depth_maps_file": "Select a single depth map file corresponding to the selected source video.",
    "output_splatted": "Path to the folder where the splatted output videos will be saved.",
    "enable_full_res": "When checked, the script will generate a splatted video at the original resolution of the input video. Uses 'Full Res Batch Size'.",
    "full_res_batch_size": "The number of frames to process simultaneously when generating the full-resolution output. A higher value uses more VRAM but can be faster. Adjust based on your GPU's memory.",

    "low_res_batch_size": "The number of frames to process simultaneously when generating the low-resolution output. Can often be higher than the full-resolution batch size due to lower memory requirements.",
    "enable_low_res_output": "If checked, an additional, smaller resolution output video will be generated alongside the main output. This is useful for quickly previewing results or for specific downstream uses. IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED to use this for inpainting as the downscaled mask will not produce a clean result. This option maybe removed in the future.",

    "max_disp": "Maximum disparity value as a percentage of the video's width x 20. Higher values result in more extreme parallax effects (depth shift). Example: '30.0' means a maximum of 1.5% shift horizontally at the forground.",
    "convergence_point": "Set the normalized depth value (0.0 to 1.0) that will appear stationary (zero horizontal shift). 0.0 is closest, 1.0 is farthest. This defines the 'screen plane' or 'convergence plane' for the stereo effect.",
    "process_length": "Set how many frames to process before moving on to the next video, used for testing. -1 will process all frames.",
    "dual_output": "If checked, the output video will show two panels: the generated occlusion mask on the left and the warped (right-eye view) video on the right. If unchecked, it will generate a 2x2 grid: Original | DepthVis (Top), Mask | Warped (Bottom).",
