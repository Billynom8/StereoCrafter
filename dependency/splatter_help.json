    "enable_full_res": "When checked, the script will generate a splatted video at the original resolution of the input video. Uses 'Full Res Batch Size'.",
    "full_res_batch_size": "The number of frames to process simultaneously when generating the full-resolution output. A higher value uses more VRAM but can be faster. Adjust based on your GPU's memory.",

    "low_res_batch_size": "The number of frames to process simultaneously when generating the low-resolution output. Can often be higher than the full-resolution batch size due to lower memory requirements.",
    "enable_low_res_output": "If checked, an additional, smaller resolution output video will be generated alongside the main output. This is useful for quickly previewing results or for specific downstream uses. IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED to use this for inpainting as the downscaled mask will not produce a clean result. This option maybe removed in the future.",

    "dual_output": "If checked, the output video will show two panels: the generated occlusion mask on the left and the warped (right-eye view) video on the right. If unchecked, it will generate a 2x2 grid: Original | DepthVis (Top), Mask | Warped (Bottom).",
    "no_normalization": "If checked, input depth maps are assumed to be raw pixel values (e.g., 0-255 for 8-bit, 0-1023 for 10-bit) and are directly scaled to a 0-1 range for splatting, without min-max analysis. Use this if your depth maps are already normalized or have a known raw range. If unchecked (default), global min/max normalization is performed.",
    "output_crf": "Constant Rate Factor (CRF) for H.264/H.265 video encoding. Lower values mean higher quality and larger file sizes. A good starting point is 18 for high quality, 23 for good quality, and 28 for lower quality. Range is typically 0-51. Ignored if hardware encoder (NVENC) is used, which uses CQ instead (CQ is internally set to match target quality).",
